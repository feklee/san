Introduction
============

*Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom* ― Aristotle

SAN (Self Aware Network) is an experiment about the [future of
architecture][1]. The network understands its own topology, a first
step towards being able to dynamically adapt to its environment.

SAN is an intermediate step: [Manifesto][6]


Getting started
===============

 1. Build nodes, edges, and the root node.

 2. Program the root node and the nodes.

 3. If using the USB root node, connect that to your computer, then run the web
    app.
    
    If using the WiFi root node, simply connect to it with a web browser.
    
 4. Build a structure.

There may be [apps][5] built on top of the system.
