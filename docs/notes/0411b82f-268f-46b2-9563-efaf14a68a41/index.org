#+TITLE: SAN: Manifesto

* Intention

The intention is to democratize architecture the way maker spaces have
democratized industrial design.  And of course we’re not creating static
buildings of the last millennium.  We’re inviting the buildings to partake in
their construction.

* What to strive for in a project

1. Accessibility: Digital fabrication lowers the barrier of entrance.  It should
   not be required to have architectural training or to possess particular
   manual skills.  Everybody is invited.

2. Inhabitability: Some of the best projects are those that are for personal
   use.  In an architectural maker space, it should be possible to live in the
   structures built, even if only temporarily.

3. Reconfigurability: In a typical maker space, a lot of prototypes go to waste.
   This is not feasible at architectural scale.  For example, instead of
   experimenting with 3D printing, it may be more interesting to work on a robot
   that can assemble and reconfigure constructions out of simple building
   blocks.  Architecture probably should be less rigid anyhow, able to adapt to
   changing needs.

4. Fast production: Ideally, constructions can be quickly assembled, for fast
   iteration and for getting results in an afternoon.

* SAN as an intermediate step

The [[https://github.com/feklee/san][Self Aware Network]] (SAN) is an intermediate step.  Individuals join a
collaborative construction process.  The network gives visual and auditory
feedback concerning how it perceives its construction and its integration with
the environment.  It is not a habitable structure however.

* Beyond SAN

- Organic buildings: Just as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Grown][chairs]] out of trees or objects out of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecovative_Design][mycelium]] –
  houses could be grown.  Such buildings are literally partaking in their
  construction.  A start would be models grown over the course of a few weeks or
  months.

- Sustainability and robotics: Robots may be able to construct individualized
  buildings from scrap found on the ground in way more sophisticated ways than
  humans.  Furthermore, buildings can be reconfigured continuously, preventing
  waste of material and offering endless possibility for play and
  experimentation.

- Let’s invent a portable machine that you can take with you, and that aids with
  building a shelter for a night.
